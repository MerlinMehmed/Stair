# Stair
The program draws a stair through given parameters from the user for step width, depth, height and full height of stair.<br />
The program gets user input through dialog in the console line. Regex is used to validate that user inputs positive number.<br />
After the user input is got, the program draws the stair. For drawing I have used FreeGLUT.<br />
There is an option to rotate the view and look at the stair from different angles.<br />
